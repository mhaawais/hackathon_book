# Tasks: Module 4 – Vision–Language–Action (VLA)

## Feature Overview
Module 4 focuses on unifying speech, vision, and planning capabilities so humanoid robots can understand natural language commands and act autonomously. This module integrates the previous modules (ROS2, Digital Twin, AI Brain) to create complete Vision-Language-Action systems that enable robots to perceive, understand, and execute complex tasks.
