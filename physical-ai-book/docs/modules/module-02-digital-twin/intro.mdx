# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Overview

Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI Book, where we explore the concept of digital twins in robotics. This module focuses on physics-based simulation and environment building for humanoid robots using Gazebo for realistic dynamics and Unity for high-fidelity interaction, including sensor simulation needed for later AI perception modules.

## What You'll Learn

In this module, you will understand how to create and work with digital twins - virtual representations of physical robots and their environments that mirror real-world properties and behaviors with high fidelity. Digital twins serve as safe, cost-effective testing grounds where robot behaviors can be developed, validated, and optimized before deployment on expensive hardware in potentially dangerous environments.

## Module Structure

This module is divided into three comprehensive chapters:

1. **Physics Simulation with Gazebo** - Understanding gravity, collisions, dynamics, and validation techniques
2. **Unity & Human–Robot Interaction** - High-fidelity rendering and interaction systems
3. **Sensor Simulation (LiDAR, Depth, IMU)** - Modeling sensors with realistic outputs and limitations

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Completed Module 1 (ROS2 concepts)
- Basic understanding of robotics terminology
- Access to appropriate simulation software (Gazebo and Unity)

## Learning Approach

This module follows a concept-first approach, where fundamental principles are explained before diving into specific examples. We maintain clear separation between physics, rendering, and sensors concepts to ensure comprehensive understanding.

## Next Steps

After completing this module, you will understand why simulation is required before deployment, be able to explain Gazebo physics concepts and validation techniques, understand Unity's role in Human-Robot Interaction and visualization, and comprehend sensor simulation outputs and limitations in preparation for Module 3 on AI perception.
