# Module 1 – The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Overview

This module introduces ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) as the foundational middleware for humanoid robotics applications. It explains how software components communicate within a robot system, how AI agents interface with robot controllers, and how humanoid robot bodies are formally described using standardized formats.

### Purpose
- Introduce ROS 2 as the communication backbone for humanoid robotics
- Explain how software components interact through nodes, topics, and services
- Demonstrate how AI agents connect to robot controllers via ROS 2
- Present URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) for humanoid representation
- Prepare learners for advanced simulation and control modules

### Target Audience
Advanced learners in AI, robotics, and physical AI systems at graduate level or senior engineering professionals who need to understand the integration of AI agents with humanoid robot platforms.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, learners will be able to:
1. Explain ROS 2 architecture and its role as a robotic nervous system
2. Describe the communication patterns between nodes, topics, and services
3. Connect Python-based AI agents to ROS 2 using rclpy
4. Understand how humanoid robots are represented using URDF
5. Prepare for simulation environments that utilize these concepts

## Prerequisites

### Assumed Knowledge
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with Python programming
- Graduate-level understanding of AI/ML concepts
- Experience with software architecture patterns

### Recommended Preparation
- Review basic robotics terminology
- Familiarize with distributed systems concepts
- Basic understanding of message-passing architectures

## Module Structure

This module is organized into three progressive chapters:

1. **[ROS 2 Fundamentals](./chapter-01-ros2-fundamentals)** — Understanding nodes, topics, services, and actions
2. **[Bridging AI Agents to Robots](./chapter-02-rclpy-ai-bridge)** — Connecting Python-based AI with rclpy
3. **[Humanoid Representation with URDF](./chapter-03-urdf-humanoids)** — Describing robots for AI reasoning

Each chapter builds upon the previous one, gradually developing your understanding of how AI agents communicate with and control humanoid robots through ROS 2.

## Integration Points

This module serves as a foundation for:
- Simulation modules (Gazebo, Isaac)
- Control system implementations
- AI-agent integration patterns
- Real-world robot deployment considerations

## Next Steps

Begin with [Chapter 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals](./chapter-01-ros2-fundamentals) to explore the core architecture of ROS 2 and its role as the communication backbone for humanoid robotics.
